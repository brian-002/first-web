                <b>Thailand</b> (Thai: ประเทศไทย),[a] historically known as <b><i>Siam</i></b>, officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia.
                It is located at the centre of the <i>Indochinese Peninsula</i>, spanning 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a population of almost 70 million people.<br><br><img class="img-1" src="" alt="a flag of Thailand"><figcaption>flag of Thailand</figcaption><br><br>
                Thailand is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and Myanmar.
                It also shares maritime borders with Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and Indonesia and India (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) on the Andaman Sea to the southwest.
                <b>Bangkok</b> is the nation's capital and largest city. Nominally, Thailand is a <i>constitutional monarchy</i> and 
                <i>parliamentary democracy</i>; however, in recent history, its government has experienced multiple coups and periods of military dictatorships.
                <br><br>Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the exonym Siamese dates to the 12th century.
                Various Indianised kingdoms such as <i>the Mon kingdoms</i>, <i>Khmer Empire</i> and<i> Malay states</i>I ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as <i>the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang</i>, <i>Sukhothai</i>, <i>Lan Na</i> and <i>Ayutthaya</i>, which rivalled each other.
                Documented European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. 
                Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan <u>Narai's reign</u>, gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the 1767 <u>Burmese–Siamese War.</u>
                Taksin quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom. He was succeeded in 1782 by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first monarch of the current<i> Chakri dynasty.</i> 
                Throughout the era of Western imperialism in Asia, <i>Siam</i> remained the only nation in the region to avoid being colonized by foreign powers, although it was often forced to cede both territory and trade concessions in unequal treaties.
                <br><br>The Siamese system of government was centralized and transformed into a modern unitary absolute monarchy in the reign of <i>Chulalongkorn.</i> In World War I, Siam sided with the allies, a political decision to amend the unequal treaties.
                Following a bloodless revolution in 1932, it became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to Thailand, which was an ally of Japan in World War II. In the late 1950s, a military coup under <i>Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat</i> revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics.
                Thailand became a major ally of the United States, and played an anti-communist role in the region as a member of the failed <b>SEATO</b>, but since 1975, had sought to improve relations with Communist China and Thailand's neighbors.
                Apart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule.
                Since the 2000s, it has been caught in a series of bitter political conflict between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, which culminated in two coups, most recently in 2014 and the establishment of its current and <b><i>20th constitution</i></b> and faces the ongoing pro-democracy protests.
                <br><br>Thailand is a middle power in global affairs, and a founding member of <b>ASEAN</b>, ranking high in the Human Development Index. It has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia, and the 20th-largest in the world by PPP.
                Thailand is classified as a newly industrialized economy; manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism are leading sectors of the economy.

            <h2>my thoughts of THAILAND</h2>
              THAILAND is a great country from what i have read and heard about it culturaly,historically and geographically.
             its cultural diversity is super amazing,having diffrent tribes with diffrent diverse cultures cohabiting and sharing there diffrent cultures among them selves and accepting each others cultures,thats makes it better for the coming generations to have a all inclusive and enjoyable lives for themselves.
             also for people who would like to move to Thailand to live there.
             historically Tnailand has an intresting history.
             education wise i think Thailand is one of the best destinations,because it will guarantee best education for you as a student.
            <h2>would i live in Thailand?</h2>
              Anyday any time,first Thailand is rich in biodiversity and as a nature lover thats a plus for me especially plant biodiversity,even though i come from a country with rich biodiversity(kenya) it will be great to visit other countries to see how they live and interact with there sarroundings.
              and the fact that one of my dreams is to travel to south east asia,then that makes Thailand a good candidate for my southeast asia adventure.
              one thing that i dont quite like about Thailand is the fact that you have to ware uniforms up to the university level of your education.
              this is to say that i would live in Thailand for other things than education even though it as great education quality.
              it is not that i would not like to study i Thailand because of the uniform,but why would i do that and there are other places where you can do your education without the uniform,but i would choose Thailand for my education if it is the only option i have,this is becase i would like to finish diffrent of my education levels of my education in separate countries.
              <h3>summury</h3> 
              thailand is a great place to live in or study
